Cloning kit and recipes detailing how to make a ~~d~~Dodo at home. This is purely experimental
and may or may not work. Because of several previous failed attempts, the kit now in
tidy version v3, is released under GPL-2.0 license. No liability.

### Curated list of facts on the ~~d~~Dodo:
- Short story on the whereabouts of ~~d~~Dodos in *Nature* ([here](https://www.nature.com/articles/443138a))
- Another *Nature* paper arguing that the mystery bird is in fact a ~~d~~Dodo relative ([here](https://www.nature.com/articles/511387a))
- Peter Griffin acknowledges that the bird is the word ([here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUi5xKQXG6I))
- A model using an optimal linear estimation method calibrated on sighting records of the ~~d~~Dodo determines when the bird finally went extinct in *Nature* ([here](https://www.nature.com/articles/426245a))
- The Dutch exonerated. An improved model narrows down the confidence interval and predicts that the final extinction of the ~~d~~Dodo lies in the time interval from 1688 to the time of the French takeover of Mauritius in 1710. There is thus a 10% chance that the ~~d~~Dodo became extinct during the French occupation ([here](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature02688))
- Although the ~~d~~Dodo is widely depicted as inept at flying, a paper in *Science* suggests that it's ungainly appearance may have been misleading. The paper is appropriately entitled "Flight of the Dodo"? ([here](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/295/5560/1683))
- In fact, another completely unrelated and totally independent piece in *Nature* says that actually the "Dodo flew to it's grave" ([here](https://www.nature.com/news/2002/020225/full/news020225-10.html))
- Dodos (*Raphus cucullatus*) were initially named *Didus ineptus*, which scientists now agree was a bit rude 
- Based on a sample of the cortical bone of a tarsal of *Raphus cucullatus*, [Shapiro *et al*](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/295/5560/1683) determined the closest living relative of the ~~d~~Dodo to be the Nicobar pigeon (*Caloenas nicobarica*) with the use of ML-based phylogenetic inference coupled with boostrapping. Given no source code was provided, we remain skeptical
- *Ralphus cucullatus* was also found to be related to the now extinct Kanaka pigeon (*Caloenas canacorum*), a species hunted to extinction after the arrival of humans to Tonga and New Caledonia ([here](https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2148-14-136)). Coincidence with the ~~d~~Dodo? Scientific consensus is currently in the negative

### What to contribute?
- Semi-scientific lucubrations about ~~d~~Dodos backed by *Nature* and *Science*
- R codes that have variables and functions referencing ~~d~~Dodos
- Stan codes that interface with R
